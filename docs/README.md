- Environment variables: [environment.md](environment.md)
- Cache semantics and layout: [caching.md](caching.md)
- Threading and parallelism: [threading.md](threading.md)
- Subblocking for large blocks: [subblocking.md](subblocking.md)
- Rust promotion baselines and gate commands: [rust/baselines.md](rust/baselines.md)

## Deep dives and engineering notes

- Stage-wise memory telemetry notes: [stage_memory_estimates.md](stage_memory_estimates.md)
- Release notes: [release_notes.md](release_notes.md)

## Planning and migration docs

- Rust and platform backlog: [work_plan.md](work_plan.md)
- General TODO plan: [general_todo_plan.md](general_todo_plan.md)
- Normalization migration plan [blocked]: [normalization_migration_blocked.md](normalization_migration_blocked.md)

## Scope notes

- Runtime and operations docs describe current behavior, knobs, and verification commands.
- Deep dives explain subsystem behavior or preserve historical context for active areas.
- Planning and migration docs can describe proposed or blocked work that is not yet part of the runtime contract.
